        "## Using Language Models in a Streaming Context to Understand Financial Markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Effective analysis of news is crucial for understanding the world, especially when it comes to financial markets. Being able to quickly identify significant events, such as a major corporation being hacked and sensitive customer data being compromised, can enable you to respond rapidly and either capitalize on opportunities or minimize losses.\n",
        "In this blog post, we'll delve into how Bytewax and large language models can be leveraged to analyze financial news in real time, providing you with the ability to respond to breaking news more effectively.\n",
        "We need to answer at least three questions to implement our little project successfully:\n",
        "* Where do we get the data?\n",
        "* How do we analyze it?\n",
        "* How do we access the data source and perform analysis in real-time?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Source\n",
        "For the data source used in this demo, we will use the [Alpaca news API](https://alpaca.markets/docs/market-data/news/#real-time-streaming), which provides websocket access to news articles from Benzinga. To setup an account and create an API key and secret, you can follow the [Alpaca documentation](https://alpaca.markets/docs/market-data/getting-started/). _You can use any websocket as a data source. A future follow-up will look at how we can build our own real-time news aggregation pipeline for analysis._\n",
        "\n",
        "## Content Analysis\n",
        "We're obviously going to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze news articles.\n",
        "And the best place which comes to mind when looking for LLMs is Hugging Face.\n",
        "[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a company that provides a marketplace where researchers can release models and datasets on their hub that can then be used by other researchers and developers via their hosted model endpoints and their Transformers library.\n",
        "Firstly, we need to perform sentiment analysis on the headline, which can quickly provide valuable insights. For this, we'll use a fine-tuned BERT model called [FinancialBERT](https://huggingface.co/ahmedrachid/FinancialBERT-Sentiment-Analysis). Then we will summarize the content of the article, and a fine-tuned [BART model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn) will come in handy for this. Both can be found on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co).\n",
        "We also are going to cover how we can use the Transformers library to run the models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Real-Time Data Processing with Bytewax\n",
        "If you are not familiar with Bytewax. Bytewax is a stateful stream processor that can be used to analyze data in real time with support for stateful operators like windowing and aggregation. Bytewax is especially suitable for workflows that leverage the Python ecosystem of tools, from data crunching tools like Pandas to machine learning-focused tools like Hugging Face Transformers. It also supports a variety of data sources, including websockets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's get started analyzing the news in real-time. First things first!\n",

        "Next up, sentiment analysis. We will use the fine-tuned Hugging Face model to analyze whether the article title is of negative or positive sentiment. We are using a BERT model in this example. The BERT model architecture (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was originally created by Google. For more details on how this model works and was trained, you can check out the [model card](https://huggingface.co/ahmedrachid/FinancialBERT-Sentiment-Analysis) on Hugging Face or the [research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358284785_FinancialBERT_-_A_Pretrained_Language_Model_for_Financial_Text_Mining). The sentiment classification will happen in a map operator since we want to analyze every news article independently. Despite all the work that is put into researching novel model architectures and putting together the training datasets, implementation is deceptively easy. \n",

Here we will use a BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) model architecture which is a combination of Google's BERT and OpenAI's GPT architectures. Once again, despite all the hardwork put into developing the model, it is relatively easy to implement with Hugging Face Transformers library. We can create a summarization pipeline and use it in a map step. One additional step was added to this map step, which was to clean the text prior to summarizing it to get better results."
